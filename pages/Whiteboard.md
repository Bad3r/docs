- # Functionality
	- Logseq [[Whiteboards]] are local-first like the rest of the software.
		- Once you create your first Whiteboard, you will find a new folder in your graphs folder structure called `whiteboards`. All the whiteboards you create will be saved there as `.edn` files. While there is other ways of [[Whiteboard/Deletion]] you can also always delete them through your file system, by removing the respective `.edn` files.

		- Whiteboards can be understood as a special type of pages. You can find them in-app in the [[Whiteboard/Dashboard]] as well as [[All pages]].
	- Currently [[Whiteboard embeds]] only work in rudimentary fashion. We plan to expand this functionality in later versions of [[Whiteboards]].
		- When referencing a [[Whiteboard]] in the outliner by it's [[Title]] you will see Whiteboard icon show up at the front of the link. Hovering that link shows you an abstracted preview of the whiteboard.
			- ![CleanShot 2022-09-22 at 17.44.08.gif](../assets/CleanShot_2022-09-22_at_17.44.08_1663861685052_0.gif)
		- Once you do a [[Page embed]] of a [[Whiteboard]] you will see the abstracted preview of the whiteboard canvas immediately in the block.

- # Background
	- What makes Logseq's [[Whiteboards]] unique is the combination of the Outliner with a spatial canvas. Thanks to [[Logseq Portal]]s you will be able to visually group and link different blocks and pages from your knowledge base as well as external media types (YouTube, Images, Websites) and simple shapes. This allows visual thinkers to compose, remix, annotate and relate contents from their knowledge base as well as emerging thoughts in a new way.
