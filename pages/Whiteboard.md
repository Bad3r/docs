	- New whiteboards can currently be created in 3 different ways:

		- [[Create]] Button
		  collapsed:: true

		- [[Search]]
		  collapsed:: true

- # Functionality
	- Logseq [[Whiteboards]] are local-first like the rest of the software.
	  collapsed:: true
		- When you create your first Whiteboard, a new folder titled `whiteboards` is added to your graph folder. All the whiteboards you create are saved in the `whiteboards` folder as `.edn` files. While there are other ways to [delete whiteboards]([[Whiteboard/Deletion]]), you can also directly delete them from your file system by removing the respective `.edn` files.
			- ![CleanShot 2022-09-22 at 17.30.29@2x.png](../assets/CleanShot_2022-09-22_at_17.30.29@2x_1663860644176_0.png)
		- Whiteboards are a special type of page. You can find them in-app in the [Whiteboards dashboard]([[Whiteboard/Dashboard]]) and [[All pages]] overview.
	- Currently, there's limited support for [[Whiteboard embeds]]. We plan to expand this functionality in later versions of [[Whiteboards]].
	  collapsed:: true
		- When referencing a [[Whiteboard]] in the outliner by its [[Title]], you will see a Whiteboard icon show up at the front of the link. Hovering that link shows you an abstracted preview of the whiteboard.
			- ![CleanShot 2022-09-22 at 17.44.08.gif](../assets/CleanShot_2022-09-22_at_17.44.08_1663861685052_0.gif)
		- Once you do a [[Page embed]] of a [[Whiteboard]], you will see the abstracted preview of the whiteboard canvas directly in the block.

- # Background
	- What makes Logseq's [[Whiteboards]] unique is the combination of the Outliner with a spatial canvas. Thanks to [[Logseq Portals]], you will be able to visually group and link different blocks and pages from your knowledge base as well as external media types (YouTube, Images, Websites) and simple shapes. This allows visual thinkers to compose, remix, annotate and relate contents from their knowledge base as well as emerging thoughts in a new way.
