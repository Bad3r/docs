- ## Usage
	- Logseq comes with two built-in flavors to mark your block with built-in workflow mark keywords and manage your tasks:
	  + `LATER` -> `NOW` -> `DONE` flavor (default)
	  + `TODO` -> `DOING` -> `DONE` flavor 
	  + You can toggle between those two flavors in setting page
	- There are two ways to attach workflow mark to your task(block)
		- when editing the block, press `Ctrl/Cmd+enter` to cycle through the workflow mark
		- type these mark as command directly, eg `/LATER` `/NOW` `/DONE` `/TODO` etc..
