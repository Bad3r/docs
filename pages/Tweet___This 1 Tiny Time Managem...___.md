	- > This 1 tiny time management tip has helped me write *every day* for 500 days in a row.
	  
	  Here's how to use it (no matter how busy you are): ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1542528394927263745))
	- > Let's start with some truth:
	  
	  If you don't set your own constraints, the world will set them for you.
	  
	  And here's my hunch:
	  
	  If you're reading this thread, you have ambitious goals.
	  
	  And those goals require big chunks of focused time and attention.
	  
	  So here's a question for you: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1542528399851274240))
	- > Over the last month, how many blocks of focused time and attention have you spent on those goals?
	  
	  Chances are, the number is far lower than you'd like.
	  
	  Because intruding on that time is a never-ending stream of competing distractions.
	  
	  The solution?
	  
	  Sacred Hours: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1542528404901306368))
	- > Sacred Hours are blocked off chunks of time that are, you guessed it, sacred.
	  
	  • Unreachable.
	  • No distractions.
	  • Fully off the grid.
	  • Defended ruthlessly.
	  
	  Just you and your work for a dedicated period of time.
	  
	  Now, how do you find that time – especially if you're busy? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1542528410081120257))
	- > To find your Sacred Hours, ask yourself these 2 questions:
	  
	  • What time of day am I most productive?
	  
	  • What time of day can I be least responsive?
	  
	  The overlap are your Sacred Hours.
	  
	  And unique to every person's Sacred Hours:
	  
	  • The time
	  • The duration
	  
	  Here's what I mean:

	- > For some, it might be 3 hours every morning.
	  
	  For others, it might be 15 minutes 2x per day during their commute.
	  
	  But no matter who you are & how hectic your calendar is, you can find this time.
	  
	  Once you choose them, there is 1 crucial step to get the most out of them: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1542528423083524096))
	- > With your Sacred Hours chosen, you have to *defend them* ruthlessly.
	  
	  And the best way to do this is to send yourself a calendar invite.
	  
	  Treat this hour as a meeting with yourself – that you can't cancel!
	  
	  Completed daily for a long period of time, these sessions compound.

	- > Now, a few quick tips to get the most out of your Sacred Hours:
	  
	  Design your workplace like an airplane cabin.
	  
	  • One task
	  • One screen
	  • No distractions
	  • Music downloaded
	  • Phone on airplane mode
	  
	  There's a reason people get their best writing done on airplanes! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1542528438590128128))
	- > As for what you work on, do not waste your Sacred Hours on any kind of shallow, monotonous work.
	  
	  Your Sacred Hours are for the creative, high-leverage, needle-moving work.
	  
	  Define what that work is – then, show up ready to execute on it every day during your Sacred Hours. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1542528443841142784))
	- > Now, I used my Sacred Hours to build a daily writing habit.
	  
	  Because personally, I think writing every day is *the* highest-leverage habit you can develop.
	  
	  And this framework has helped over 4,000 people start writing every day inside Ship 30 for 30:

	- > But no matter your goal, finding & using your Sacred Hours will make reaching them inevitable.
	  
	  So ask yourself these 2 questions:
	  
	  • What time of day am I most productive?
	  
	  • What time of day can I be least responsive?
	  
	  Pick time from that overlap.
	  
	  Then, get to work.
