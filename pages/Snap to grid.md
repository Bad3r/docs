# Functionality
	- When turned on, creating/translating/scaling should follow the grid. [[Pencil]] and [[Highlight]] tools should not be affected by it. The snapping step is fixed to the defaultÂ grid size, regardless of the camera zoom level. The grid adjusts when you zoom in and out, so snapping will not always be aligned with the visible grid.
# Background
	- This feature is helpful when we want to align [[Shapes]] without using guides or any other snapping utilities.
