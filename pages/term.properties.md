- **Description**
	- Properties are key-value pairs that allow you to annotate a block or page.
	- _Page properties_ are defined by putting them into the first block of the page (_frontmatter_).
	- _Block properties_ are defined by putting them into any other block.
	- Any page or block can have multiple pairs of properties.
	- Property values are primarily used for linking to other pages in the following ways:
	  collapsed:: true
		- When a property value matches an existing page title, Logseq will automatically create a link to that page
		- When a property contains commas (`,`), any values are going to be automatically linked:
		  ```
		  parts:: motor, steering wheel, tyres
		  ```
		- When a property contains references, (`[]`), any values are going to be automatically linked:
		  ```
		  parts:: [[motor]], steering wheel, tyres
		  ```
		- To prevent values from being auto-linked, wrap _all_ values within quotes (`"`) - for example, `parts:: "[[motor]], steering wheel, tyres"`
		  You cannot quote (unlink) _parts_ (items) of a list property, e.g. `parts:: [[motor]], "steering wheel, tyres"` is not going to prevent values from being linked.
- TODO This page is too big. Split it up into multiple feature pages e.g. page properties, block properties, built-in properties #docs
- **Usage**
	- To enter a property, type `::` to autocomplete a property name. After entering a property name, autocomplete a property value that is _specific_ to that property. To see this in action, [see this demo](https://www.loom.com/share/27804e1bcd7b4e4bbf71ec14956c42fe).

- **Examples**
	- I'm an apple block with below custom properties
	  id:: 60a78e9e-59dc-40ab-9a01-5317dc09365f
	  color:: red
	  origin:: Spain
	- this **first block** of this page serves an example for **page property**
	- let's add two more books:
	  collapsed:: true
		- [[How to take smart notes]]
		  updated-at:: 1609337624066
		  created-at:: 1609233078964
		  type:: [[book]]
		  author:: [[s√∂nke ahrens]]
		  publication_date:: [[february 21, 2017]]
		  price:: 10

		- [[How to solve it]]

		  qty:: 2
- **Configuration** in [[config.edn]]
	- Properties have their own pages by default. To disable this, `:property-pages/enabled? false`
	- TODO Add #docs for other property related configs
- **Properties** have multiple use cases including:
	- Selecting (querying) specific pages/blocks:
	  collapsed:: true
		- For example, let's query all the blocks with the property `type` and the value `book`: #examples #books
		  collapsed:: true
		  {{query (property type book)}}
		- Or we can use [[Advanced Queries]]:
			- #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
			   #+BEGIN_QUERY
			   {:title [:h2 "My books"]
			    :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
			   :where
			   [?b :block/properties ?p]
			   [(get ?p :type) ?t]
			   [(= "[[book]]" ?t)]]}
			   #+END_QUERY
			   #+END_SRC
			- #+BEGIN_QUERY
			  {:title [:h2 "My books"]
			   :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
			  :where
			  [?b :block/properties ?p]
			  [(get ?p :type) ?t]
			  [(= "[[book]]" ?t)]]}
			  #+END_QUERY
	- Providing common attributes to your pages/block - for example, you could have a template `Book` and a list of attributes you want to define for each book:
	  ```
	  author: [[george polya]]
	  title: Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning
	  published: 2009
	  ```
- **Built-in Properties**
	- There are built-in in properties that control Logseq functionality. Most of the these properties are hidden from the user but a few are user editable. These property names are reserved for Logseq and thus _must_ not be used as a user property.
	- Legend for properties below:
	  * (1) and (N) indicate how many values you may define, one and multiple values respectively.
	  * (page) and (block) indicates a property is a page property or block property only. Otherwise a property can be both a page property and block property.
	- Editable properties
		- `icon` (1) (page) - define icon identifier for a page.
		- `title` (1) (page) - overrides the title of a page to be different from the file name.
		- `tags` (N) - get listed in their own section "Pages tagged with X" below a page.
		- `template` (1) - designates a page/block as a template.
		- `template-including-parent` (1) - specifies whether the parent level content of the selected block should be included when using a template. previously called `include-parent`
		- `alias` (N) - define synonyms for a page.
		- `filters` (N) (page) - store selected filters for linked references on page-level. object with booleans
		- `public` (1) (page) - defines whether a page should be included in an export. boolean
		- `exclude-from-graph-view` (1) (page) - defines whether a page should be excluded in global graph view. boolean
	- Hidden properties
		- `collapsed` (1) (block) - specifies whether a block is collapsed.
		- `id` (1) (block) - specifies a block id.
		- `created-at` (1) (block) - deprecated property that defines the created date/time stamps in [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)
		- `updated-at` (1) (block) - deprecated property that defines the updated date/time stamps in [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). previously `last-modified-at`
		- `query-table` (1) (block) - marks a query to be shown as the table view.
		- `query-properties` (N) (block) - properties user has chosen to see in query table.
		- `query-sort-by` (1) (block) - property by which to sort query table
		- `query-sort-desc` (1) (block) - property sort direction. boolean where true is descending
