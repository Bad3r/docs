	- > **Make sure that "real users" drive the process**. Accurate user archetypes are based on close observation of real users -- their needs, their wants, their behavior. This may seem self-evident, but I suspect that the "Jason" had his genesis not in the lives of real car buyers but out of the need or desire on the part of Honda to assure that the RDX was true to their vision of the Acura nameplate and that the RDX was clearly distinguished from the similar Honda CR-V. To convince themselves that a member of their vehicle portfolio was distinct, they created a "vision" of its buyer that was also distinct, and self-fulfilling. And, evidently, inaccurate.

Understanding both users is crucial to marketers, but confusing them can cause problems. For example, the media behaviors of real and aspirational users can be different. Building a media plan on the tastes of the aspirational user may not reach the real target. Again, Honda may have erred in this direction. Jason seems much more like someone to whom an RDX user might aspire. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3yjv3cny3bwhvtnss1kdkpa))

	- > Ultimately, take your user archetype out for a test drive. Once you have created the archetype, see if you can actually find real representatives. Talk to them; listen to them. Does the archetype resonate with them? Remember, the archetype is a construct to guide your actions, so they are unlikely to play it back literally and verbatim. But, if the archetype is well constructed, it should reflect their needs, desires, hopes, and fears. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g3yjy57m7q1ph6h9hygw3ftb))
