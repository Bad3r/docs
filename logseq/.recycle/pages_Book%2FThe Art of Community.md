- # [[Highlights]]
	- > Our function as community leaders is to enable people to be the best they can be in the community they have chosen to be a part of. Our job is to help our community members achieve their greatest ambitions, and to help them work with other members to realize not only their own personal goals, but also the goals of the community itself.

		- #Notes What's the main job of the community manager? #[[inbox]]
	- > although your teams have a primary focus (such as translations), there will be many other skills present in your teams, and many people will be in multiple teams. We need to not only foster effective communication between teams (such as regular meetings, progress checks, and shared communication mediums) but also make use of people who have their feet in multiple teams. They can be the glue that sticks teams together. These people should absolutely be on your Christmas card list. ([Location 925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=925))
		- #Notes How can you ensure that different teams communicate with each other?
	- > To get started, you first need to answer some simple yet broad questions. Write down a single detailed sentence or a collection of single words that answers the following: What is the mission? We want to understand our primary mission — the bright, shiny prize for which we encourage and inspire our community. What is this eventual outcome that we lust for? Is it a software release, political change, to help a demographic of people, or to produce something? What are the opportunities and areas of collaboration? We want to explore how our community can work together to create and achieve things. What are these areas? How can we work together in different ways? What are the skills required? We want to identify what skills we need in our community so that we can later establish teams to house these skills. What are these skills? ([Location 1273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=1273))
		- #Notes What are the questions to start the strategic plan for a community?
	- > MISSION: To produce an integrated audio production environment for the purposes of recording, mixing, and exporting audio built on the principles of ease of use and simplicity, utilizing open source technology. OPPORTUNITIES: Easing audio production, rethinking assumed knowledge, and asking questions in an integrated environment, and open and free access to simple audio production technology. AREAS OF COLLABORATION: Interface design, development, documentation, translations, testing. SKILLS REQUIRED: Programming (audio, interface), documentation, web design, web content, testing, bug triage, translations. ([Location 1285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=1285))
		- #Notes Example of strategic community plan
	- > Distilling the broad goals of the project into a single sentence helps you to understand what you really want to achieve. It also gives you a great summary of the project that you can share within minutes. This is called the elevator pitch and is useful for attracting new contributors and spreading the word about your community. ([Location 1299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=1299))
		- #Notes Why should you write an elevator pitch for your community?
	- > The “OPPORTUNITIES” answer is the area in which you should identify all the exciting opportunities that are possible if you achieve your goals with the community. Producing revolutionary software? Changing the quality of life for homeless people in your neighborhood? Furthering a particular skill? Helping kids to eat healthy foods? Whatever your dreams, these should be the most important and inspiring opportunities that you are seeking. Remember, we are looking for high-level, essential goals here. ([Location 1302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=1302))
		- #Notes What do the opportunities for your community describe?
	- > The “AREAS OF COLLABORATION” answer is where you can note the areas in which the community can work together on a task. This could include writing documentation, organizing events, performing advocacy, writing software, etc. Some tasks in the project cannot or will not be collaborative (e.g., administering the infrastructure facilities for the community); you obviously should not include these. ([Location 1306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=1306))
		- #Notes What do you describe in areas of collaboration in your strategic community plan?
	- > The “SKILLS REQUIRED” part is where you should note the skills that are required to make your mission a reality. What types of skills are needed to achieve those goals? Scribble down the full range of skills that you will need. This explicit statement will be handy later when attracting contributors. ([Location 1309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=1309))
		- #Notes Why do you need to include required skills in your strategic community plan?
	- > There are many approaches to building a strategic document in an open and inclusive way, but here is my recommended approach: Have a central place in which the strategic documentation is developed. I recommend a website or wiki. Ensure that everyone in your community has access to this location. As you work through the concepts in this chapter, engage in public discussions with your community to make decisions. This could happen in face-to-face meetings or in online mediums, such as mailing lists and forums. Gather this feedback and use it as a basis for additions to the plan. Regularly update the documentation and solicit feedback from the wider community on your changes. ([Location 1332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=1332))
		- #Notes A recommended approach to creating a strategic plan together with the community.
	- > a mission statement holds a lot of value for any kind of collaborative project, be it a commercial product or a volunteer community. These statements emphasize the promise, opportunity, and definition of what your community is seeking to achieve. Their purpose is to articulate ambition with a detailed, succinct, and elegant approach. Mission statements help get everyone in your community on the same page. ([Location 1368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=1368))
		- #Notes Why is it useful to define a mission statement?
	- > Mission statements are intended to be consistent and should rarely change, even if the tasks that achieve that mission change regularly. When building your mission statement, always have its longevity in mind. Remember, your mission statement is your slam-dunking, audacious goal. For many communities these missions can take decades or even longer to achieve. Their purpose is to not only describe the finish line, but also help the community stay on track. ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=1371))
		- #Notes How often should your mission statement change?
	- > Your community members need to be able to draw a connection between the daily work of the community and your mission. ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=1378))
		- #Notes What should a mission statement contain? #[[c2]]
	- > Your mission should define the purpose of your aims, the bigger picture of where they fit in, and the uniqueness of your approach. ([Location 1381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=1381))
	- > The purpose of a strategic plan is to document your goals and ambitions for a given period of time and to provide a central body of agreement in your organization or community. It should clarify what your objectives are and which goals are part of those objectives; it should also state how progress is measured and who is leading the work. A detailed, realistic strategic plan is hugely valuable for your community. ([Location 1400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=1400))
		- #Notes What's the purpose of a strategic plan?
	- > Our approach here involves defining a number of objectives. These are the broad, high-level things that you want to achieve. Each objective is divided into a number of goals. Each goal includes three pieces of information. The success criteria describe a set of measurable methods for evaluating the goal’s success. You should be able to look at this statement and determine straightaway whether the goal was achieved (example: 20 new community members). The implementation plan describes what tasks need to happen to achieve the goal. These are a set of directions that clearly indicate the steps involved in achieving the goal. Finally, and this is optional with many communities, we specify the owner: the person responsible for the goal. Accountability is an important element in building successful community: when people feel responsible for their work, they ensure that positive outcomes are generated. ([Location 1443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=1443))
		- #Notes How do you define objectives for a strategic plan?
	- > For each team you should produce a mission statement that outlines the specific work that the team performs. With this statement available for each team, you will better understand how your teams fit together, and so will prospective contributors: this statement will help you articulate the purpose of the team and help new contributors know which team to join. ([Location 1634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=1634))
		- #Notes Why should teams also have a mission statement?
	- > As before, your definition should explain the typical activities that the team will do. As an example, the following could be used to describe a documentation team: The documentation team identifies and prioritizes areas in which documentation is required, builds processes for producing high-quality documentation and best practice, and produces said documentation. ([Location 1637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=1637))
		- #Notes What should a team mission statement describe?
	- > Setting expectations is critical in building community. When expectations are unrealistic or misaligned, the community forms its own theories. This can be a rocky road. The problem is that of Chinese Whispers (also known as Telephone, to some) — the game where a message passes from one person to another and changes at each step until the original meaning is garbled. When an expectation is surprising, often guesses and assumption are communicated as fact. This causes misinformation, concern, and typically negative outcomes. ([Location 1670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=1670))
		- #Notes Why shohld you be transparent and set expectations towards your community?
	- > Another key consideration when building effective communication channels is keeping discussion focused. This is a two-part process in avoiding communication fetishism and also keeping all your eyeballs in one place. Communication fetishism is particularly prevalent in online and technical communities and points to the problem of new communities wanting to provide every possible communication channel under the sun. They set up mailing lists, forums, IRC channels, Second Life worlds, and more. This is the wrong thing to do. You should instead identify the key roles and personalities in your project and choose mediums that make the most sense to those roles. ([Location 1958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=1958))
		- #Notes Why should you avoid different communication channels for your community?
	- > When you set up a new community, you want to generate discussion quickly. You want to initiate the discussion but encourage and inspire others to participate and get involved. If you have a forum with too many subforums, you will fragment the discussion: you will get many tiny bits of discussion across the subforums, and little consistency. Keep the discussion in just a few places, and conversation will flow. This happens because people waste time choosing the right forum instead of just posting. What is worse, some get confused and just don’t post at all. Discussion gets going faster when you have fewer choices. ([Location 1977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=1977))
		- #Notes Why do you need to keep the number of subforums low?
	- > In many online communities there are often localized technical cultural norms that are in play. These are small conventions and methods of communicating that are typically localized to a community, be it online or physical. Respect for these conventions and (often unwritten) rules is known as netiquette. ... Unfortunately, communities often fail to document these expectations around discussion, and many innocent bystanders get short shrift when they accidentally get it wrong. You should always try to document these expectations around communication on your community’s website. ([Location 2147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2147))
		- #Notes Why should you document the netiquette of your community?
	- > There are two approaches that can help prevent this problem from occurring. First, you should not discuss topics in too much detail without connecting them to specific plans. Ask who is going to work on what, when the work is likely to be completed, and how you can help. ([Location 2193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2193))
	- > Another solution is to build a culture of experiments in which your members channel their energy into a specific project that can be proposed to your community at a later date. This has been a popular approach in the open source GNOME desktop community. Many developers have worked on their own pet projects that involve a handful of developers. These projects are created, enhanced, and refined, and when they are mature enough, they are proposed for inclusion in the main GNOME desktop. This is an excellent, productive, and engaging approach to creating things together. ([Location 2197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2197))
	- > When producing documents that you want your community to read and act on, don’t be lured into filling them with meaningless buzzwords, overly complex descriptions, and other fluff. Take Zinsser’s advice and try to write and produce documents that are simple, easy to read, and designed for the audience who should read them. Simplicity in writing will ensure that your community can do great work easily. ([Location 2316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2316))
		- #Notes Why should your processes be written in simple and clear language?
	- > A consciousness of processes is good; obsessing over them is bad and breeds bureaucracy. We always need to keep our eyes on the prize. I raise this distinction for an important reason: building processes is a core activity in governing a group of people. Unfortunately, all too often the act of governing can overtake the goals of the governance. Always bear this in mind when building your processes, and always ensure that you are not building processes for the sake of building processes. Not all problems can be solved with documentation and rules. ([Location 2476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2476))
		- #Notes Why should you care about processes, but not obsess over them?
	- > I was working at home one day when I got an email that told a stunning story. The sender was a kid (unfortunately, I can’t remember his name) who was living with his family in a remote region of Africa. Some time ago some visitors had come to his village and these visitors had laptops that were running Ubuntu (the software we produce at Canonical). When the kid asked these people what was on their computers and they mentioned Ubuntu, it immediately resonated: the word ubuntu is an ancient African word meaning “humanity to others.” This piqued the kid’s interest and he asked for more information about the software. They then told him how the software was entirely open and created by a global community who worked together to create software that people could share with one another. Although the kid had spent little time in front of computers (he didn’t own one and had no access to the Internet), he was absolutely fascinated by the premise of Ubuntu and open source and this culture of sharing. He felt compelled to participate. He told me that, to earn money, on weekdays he would do odd jobs and bits of work around his village when he was not at school, and then on the weekends he would walk three hours to the nearest town and spend his money in an Internet café, where he would pay for an hour’s worth of Internet time and use it to contribute to Ubuntu. After his hour was up he would walk three hours back to his village, excited about his contributions. He did this every weekend and told me that all week he would look forward to the weekend to contribute to Ubuntu. I was moved by this email. Not only did it demonstrate the sheer humanity and good nature of this kid, but it also demonstrated how powerful inspiration and community can move people. Importantly, though, and related to this chapter, it gave me a new way to define and assess my work. My job was simple: to help that kid get the most out of his hour. If he was spending his week earning money to contribute to Ubuntu, and was willing to walk six hours in one day to contribute to our community, it was my responsibility to help him not only enjoy his hour, but also have few, if any, obstacles and barriers to overcome in order to participate. This meant ensuring that the processes that were part of Ubuntu were slim, efficient, and designed to help our contributors achieve great things. ([Location 2483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2483))
		- #Notes Why should you make community processes easy and fun?
	- > When we take a laissez-faire approach to processes, we put confidence in our community at risk. Processes are the conceptual buttons that your community members push to make things happen, and when those buttons don’t work as expected, people get bored and frustrated and move on. On the other hand, if we craft smooth, efficient, and effective processes, our community feels nimble, responsive, and great to be part of. ([Location 2534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2534))
		- #Notes Why should you take community processes seriously?
	- > When you need to build a process for something (such as how members join your community), note the following criteria: Goal What is the goal of the process? What does it seek to achieve? What is the outcome when the process has been followed? Target participants Who is the process designed for? Is it intended for a particular kind of contributor, such as a developer, documentation writer, translator, or advocate? Requirements What tools, knowledge, and experience must the contributor have in order to follow through with the process? If she does not possess these requirements, how can she obtain them easily? Are these requirements a barrier to entry (such as entry fees or limited availability)? Steps involved What are the chronological steps involved in achieving the goal? What could go wrong? Is it possible for people to accidentally fail to complete a step? How is feedback provided about each step? Who provides the feedback? Verification Who decides when a process has been completed successfully? Also, how is successful completion of the process communicated to the contributor? ([Location 2568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2568))
		- #Notes What are the five criteria for community processes?
	- > The most important ingredient when building processes is an understanding of people and their expectations. And this understanding requires you to solicit feedback, along with a culture devoted to always improving and refining your processes. When we understand and react to participants’ expectations, processes behave as participants expect them to. Part of the reason why feedback is so important is that it prevents bureaucracy: rules that are maintained because “they are the rules.” Spread the message in your community that tomorrow may always bring a better way to carry out a current process. Processes provide an excellent opportunity to simplify tasks, tend to needs, and help your community focus on innovating more easily. Encourage and enthuse your community to question your processes. This feedback will keep your processes on their toes and protected from the dreaded B-word. ([Location 2642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2642))
		- #Notes Why should you always be asking feedback about your community processes?
	- > All volunteer communities thrive on a sense of openness, because they are associative. These communities are built by people who choose to live their lives there. People who participate in a volunteer community do so because they enjoy it: it is not a job or a requirement. As such, to keep them involved, there needs to be a sense that their input is valuable, and this absolutely applies to their input on how well community processes are working. Ask yourself this question: would you rather live in a community where you can have an impact on the governing rules, or a community in which other people decide? ... These risks with transparency can happen to any volunteer community. The solution to this is simple: involve your community at every step of your community growth. Involve them in the strategy, the processes, the governance, the execution of these decisions, and more. Have public communication channels and public meetings, and instead of questioning whether something should be public, question whether it should be private. When we work together, the world feels like a very open place. ([Location 2652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2652))
		- #Notes Why is openness crucial for volunteer communities?
	- > Most software releases adhere to the following broad set of milestones: Development begins. Feature freeze. User interface freeze. Beta freeze. Beta release. Translations freeze. Release candidate. Final release. ([Location 2709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2709))
		- #Notes What is a common release cycle for open-source software?
	- > If you want people to stick around, you need to offer them a regular sense of achievement. Your community members need to feel (a) that they are productive, (b) that their contributions are appreciated, and (c) that (a) and (b) happen repeatedly. This is particularly important for new contributors. ([Location 2797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2797))
		- #Notes What are key ingredients to keep contributors?
	- > When someone first expresses interest in joining your community, she needs to follow what I call the contributor ramp: Identify an area in which she can contribute Learn the skills required to contribute Know which specific task to work on Know how to submit her work When you start attracting people to your community, you are encouraging them to begin interfacing with this process. As such, you need to make sure you have all of the above in order before you even make a peep. The most logical home for this information is your website. ([Location 2799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2799))
		- #Notes What does the contributor on-ramp look like?
	- > Gathering feedback from the outside world is an often-overlooked but important facet of a strong and healthy community. Feedback is important for providing you with others’ perspectives, and these perspectives can help identify opportunities, problems, and areas that need renewed focus. It is this feedback that tells you what people outside your community think of your goals, ambitions, and progress. As such, feedback is a positive double-edged sword: not only does it provide pleasant confirmation of things we’re doing right, but it also reveals and focuses our minds on areas to improve. ... Unfortunately, many community leaders view feedback as a nuisance, and disregard it if it challenges their work and the norms of the community. This is the wrong perspective to take. Feedback instead offers us an incredible opportunity to improve how our community functions. ([Location 2880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2880))
		- #Notes Why should you welcome external feedback with open arms?
	- > You may not want to have everyone and her dog see this feedback (although it is an impressive message of transparency if you do). What’s more, remember that search engines will index this potentially negative feedback, showing it to everyone who searches on your project name, even if you’ve since addressed the problems. ([Location 2919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2919))
		- #Notes What must you keep in mind about receiving public feedback?
	- > The documentation behind a process should be as close as possible to a cooking recipe: do this…do that…get this result. The emphasis here is on quick, clear, straight-to-the-point directions. Processes are fundamentally a collection of steps with an outcome. Documenting them is similar to Ikea’s instructions for putting together a shelving unit. How can you tell the user how to achieve the outcome as easily and effectively as possible? ([Location 2944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2944))
		- #Notes What is key to keep in mind with regards to simplicity when designing processes?
	- > To get you started, let’s get introspective for a while and document your own steps for writing a process: First, write down the end goal of your process. What does it achieve? Now, in numerical and chronological order, write down each step in your process, using a single word to describe each step. Finally, for each word, write a single sentence that clearly explains what is involved in the step. ([Location 2950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2950))
		- #Notes What’s the three-step process to designing processes?
	- > When you announce your processes, you should include the following details: The problem you sought to solve A single paragraph overview of the process and how it works A link to the online documentation that explains how the process works A final paragraph that strongly encourages the community to make use of the process ([Location 2981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2981))
		- #Notes What are four key ingredients when announcing new processes?
	- > Communities generally follow by example: members look toward other people to engage with processes before they do it themselves. You need to put a few examples of successful use of each process in place as a head start to get the community to accept the processes. A useful approach is to pick four or five key community members and ensure that they are fully behind the process you have announced. You should regularly check in with these members to ensure that they are making use of the process, and when they are not, you should check why and remind them where needed. You should also encourage these key members to spread their best practices throughout the community. ([Location 2992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=2992))
		- #Notes How can you get buy-in for processes through positive examples?
	- > In my on-ramp there are four steps, each of which is important in the community member collaboration experience. They can be summarized as follows: Identifying the on-ramp For a community member to be able to participate, he needs to know he can participate. We need to be able to reach out and make it clear that collaboration and contributions are not only possible, but also actively encouraged. Developing knowledge With any kind of collaboration a set of skills and knowledge is required in order for people to take part. As an example, if you want to write documentation, you need to know how to write the documentation, how the tools work, and how to contribute your work to the community. We want to make this skills acquisition process as simple as possible. Determining contributions When you know you can participate and have the knowledge to do so, you then need to know what to work on. Which areas need participation and contributions? Which problems need fixing? We want to have a solid set of things that people can pick up and do. Growing kudos Finally, when a community member has contributed something to the community, you want to ensure that he feels a sense of appreciation (what I call kudos) for his contribution. ([Location 3017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=3017))
		- #Notes What is a recommended four-step on-ramp to make community members sustainable contributors?
	- > In the Ubuntu community we served these kinds of needs in a few different ways. First we encouraged the community to document help and guidance that could be useful to others. This included the creation of a knowledge base of content and an actively communicated ethos that the knowledge base should be added to and extended when someone noticed that a key piece of information or guidance was missing. This would result in a growing resource of help and guidance. We augmented this work with a set of Ubuntu training weeks. These events would produce a week-long set of tutorial sessions, many of which referenced this preexisting documentation, but these sessions also actively focused on teaching a particular skill or approach in the community (e.g., how to create documentation, how to fix a bug, etc.). Finally, we provided a number of resources for getting help and guidance. This includes a web-based question and answer service, real-time IRC discussion channels, mailing lists, and more. This collection of resources would help provide all the necessary steps for prospective community members to up-skill themselves to contribute effectively. ([Location 3070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=3070))
		- #Notes What did the Ubuntu community do to increase documentation, thus knowledge, in their community?
	- > I have traditionally focused on encouraging an appreciation culture in two core forms: Broadcast appreciation Broadcasting out to the wider community appreciation for work and accomplishments made by particular teams or people Contextual appreciation Saying thanks for work and accomplishments to the people who did them at a one-to-one level Both of these approaches are important within collaborative communities. From the perspective of the community member being thanked, the broadcast approach is nice to see as you feel a sense of appreciation disseminated across the wider community; the wider community see that you did a great job. The contextual approach is nice to see to provide a general sense of appreciation in your day-to-day activities; you do something and someone says thanks and it makes the community feel positive and fun. ([Location 3122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=3122))
		- #Notes What are two ways you can encourage an appreciation culture?
	- > I recommend following these steps to carve out a method of handling these sessions: Make a list of all the processes that are involved in your community. This should cover topics such as how people get involved, how you work together, how teams work, and so on. I recommend you do this in an online document, such as a wiki page. For each process, include bullet points outlining the feedback you have heard, both good and bad. Look at the full list and reorganize it into what you consider priority order. This is most typically driven by which processes are causing bottlenecks and problems in your community. Inform the wider community of the list and ask people to either edit the list directly (if they can, such as with a wiki) or submit feedback for you to add to the list. You should ask for feedback about the processes and which processes they consider the most important to discuss. Give them a deadline for feedback that is before the reassessment sessions. Merge this feedback into the document and reprioritize the list based on the consensus. This list is your agenda for the meetings. When you get together with the community, pick the top processes and discuss them in turn. Communicate the good and bad feedback with the community, and focus the discussion on coming up with modifications to the processes that may be an improvement. Always keep these discussions focused on achieving outcomes; they can quickly degenerate into fruitless conversations. When you reach consensus on changes to these processes, you should ensure that the changes are noted down in the session. These notes provide a TODO list of changes to your process documentation. Remember that each time a process changes, you should announce it to the wider community, just as you did with new processes.

	- > Tools are a means to an end. They are used to produce an item that is more interesting than the raw materials and devices used to manipulate it. To select the right tools for a job, we first need to understand what we are trying to achieve. We need to know what our workflow is. ([Location 3244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=3244))
		- #Notes What is crucial to know before you choose a tool for a workflow?
	- > A successful workflow requires understanding what you want to achieve and making the steps in which you achieve it as simple as possible for as many people as possible. ([Location 3258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=3258))
		- #Notes What is key to a successful workflow?
	- > People always have expectations. Our job is to understand, predict, and cater to fair expectations in our target audience. To understand these expectations, we need to understand our audience. ... Understanding the audience requires observing them in their natural environment. If you want to make bug triage as simple as possible, sit down and watch someone triage a number of bugs. In fact, watch a range of people triage bugs. ... This feedback is always valuable. Identify the parallels between the multiple people who perform the same type of task (such as programming), and you begin to build a mental picture of their expectations and experience. ([Location 3272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=3272))
		- #Notes How can you form a picture of your audience's expectations?
	- > Importantly, your community members can help you to understand these roles, too, but you really need to figure out their current workflow and ask them for specific feedback about its different parts. Have a series of frank and honest conversations about the overall workflow. This provides community members with an opportunity to share how the workflow benefits their lives and how it complicates them. You should also get to know their general perspectives and opinions that surround the workflow. As an example, if you are talking to a programmer, ask for her opinions on related topics such as testing, bugs and triage, translations, code commenting, documentation, and other topics; this will help you build a better sense of her views and expectations. While having these conversations, take copious notes: the devil is almost always in the details, and you don’t want to lose anything. ([Location 3296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=3296))
		- #Notes How can you understand your contributors' roles and workflows?
	- > A common problem that can occur when observing how people use software is when the user knows of a particular quirk in a product and works to naturally avoid triggering the quirk. This is common with software developers, and before release, the software typically is not used in the same manner as it is by normal users after release. A good antidote to this problem is to simply put new users in front of the software who are entirely unaware of the quirks and oddities. They can often present the most valuable feedback. ([Location 3314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=3314))
		- #Notes How can you avoid testers to work around quirks, instead triggering errors before release?
	- > Once you have written your workflow steps into your functional spec, you should go through each step and ask the following questions of it: Is this step really required? How easy is this step to understand? Could it be simplified? Are the requirements easy to obtain or access? When you have applied these questions to each step, you can apply these questions to the entire workflow: Is this workflow as efficient as it could be? Is this the most intuitive approach to the workflow? Is this workflow scalable? ([Location 3344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=3344))
		- #Notes What questions should you ask to first refine the steps, and then the workflow overall?
	- > Identify the primary ways in which you collaborate. These are the areas in which your tools and workflow should be as flawless and intuitive as possible. In our example, we identified bugs as a key area. Understand the problem. How does your community understand and engage in the process you are exploring? Which parts of the problem are more problematic than others? What do you want to achieve? In our example, we knew that linking was a problem, and focused on it. Break down the workflow. When you understand your areas of focus, examine the process and ask whether each step is entirely necessary or could be improved.

		- #Notes What are the three steps to ensure you build an environment/infrastructure that will support your ultimate goals?
	- > When you have decided on your toolchain, you should ensure that it is well documented on your community’s website. You should specify: The tools that are used in your project Where you can obtain the tools required Instructions for how to use these tools to obtain the work your community produces (such as the source code for an application) and how to run it ([Location 3684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=3684))
		- #Notes What three things about your community toolchain should you document?
	- > One of the most useful lessons that I have learned in my community work is that you should regularly reassess everything: your workflow, processes, governance, and anything else. A community is built on a set of rapidly changing people, needs, and requirements. Regular reassessment is important to ensure that your workflow is matching the day-to-day work of your community. ([Location 3770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=3770))
		- #Notes Why should you regularly (at least once a year) reassess your community workflows, processes, tools, etc.?
	- > Building effective workflows is complex. It involves a combination of understanding people, technology, and usability. As is a common theme throughout this book, you should look to simplicity as your inspiration. At every step of the way, you need to ask questions: Is this more complicated than it needs to be? Is this the most effective way to do this? Is my community going to be able to follow this workflow every day and not get frustrated? ([Location 3795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=3795))
		- #Notes What questions should you ask regularly about your community workflows?
	- > Broadcasting Social media is useful for sharing events, developments, content, and other things going on in our community. Well-crafted social media channels can communicate our news and ideas to a significant number of people. What’s key is not just the volume of content or the number of people who see it, but communicating interesting content to the right kinds of people. Feedback Social media can be a tremendous tool for getting better feedback on what our community members, users, customers, and other people think about us and our community. Seeing and understanding our work and its effect is a key part of understanding how to do better, and social media can be hugely helpful here. Collaboration Social media can also be a useful tool for collaborating with others, planning events and projects, and more. In addition, it is a useful means of encouraging others to participate in collaborative campaigns and efforts. ([Location 3892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=3892))
		- #Notes What are three areas that social media can help communities with?
	- > Here are a few prime pieces of social media meat that you may want to consider sharing: News Your community will thirst after every drop of news they can find. Be sure to have a blog, post plenty of news to it, and share links to the news across your social networks. Progress updates If your community is building something (such as a piece of software, a product, or a service) be sure to share plenty of updates about what new features you are bringing to it. Visual things such as photos, screenshots, and videos are always very popular. Events Be sure to broadcast not only community events, but also the details of how these events are coming together (e.g., the call for papers, the final schedule, the attendee lists, etc.). Meetings Whether you have online or face-to-face meetings, share announcements about them so that people know to attend. Also broadcast the meeting notes/summary. Accomplishments If your community enjoys some achievement (X number of users/downloads, press reviews, testimonials, etc.), be sure to share it. Statements If you need to make a formal statement (e.g., in response to criticism), be sure to broadcast the statement or a link to a web page containing the statement. Kudos It is nice to specifically highlight people or groups in your community for their good work and to broadcast a short message celebrating their work. Kudos goes a long way toward building goodwill. ([Location 4108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4108))
		- #Notes What types of content are worth broadcasting on social media?
	- > Of course, when you do have a popular campaign on a social media network, be sure to use it for a useful purpose. Unfortunately, many community leaders build all this momentum for people to join and then don’t provide opportunities for them to work on. When people take part, be sure there is a clear on-ramp of things they can participate in and be sure to celebrate their accomplishments with the rest of the group. ([Location 4399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4399))
		- #Notes What do you need to take care of before even thinking of running social media campaigns for your community?
	- > it is also important to note that the process of building buzz in community does not need to be centralized. You don’t need to appoint a marketing manager for the community and have everything go through him. You should instead encourage everyone in your community to learn the skills behind building great buzz. This harks back to business expert Peter Drucker’s often-cited lesson that great customers help create great customers. You should likewise help your contributors encourage and enthuse other contributors to join the community. I would highly recommend that you send this chapter to your contributors in your project to help them learn the building blocks of buzz. ([Location 4676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4676))
		- #Notes Why don't you need a marketing manager for a community?
	- > Your mission is critical to building buzz. First of all, you can’t expect to generate excitement around an idea you can’t articulate, so by developing a mission statement you sow the seeds of buzz. Second, developing a mission statement trains you to describe your goals and excitement succinctly. The mission is what will pique the interest of your next generation of community members. ([Location 4684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4684))
		- #Notes Why do you need a mission statement before you try to generate buzz?
	- > Buzz is all about excitement, and excitement is about dreams. We need to present a dream so compelling that it will inspire people to join you to make it happen. ([Location 4692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4692))
		- #Notes What do you need to give people if you want to generate buzz?
	- > When delivered well, this kind of motivational writing can make those little hairs on the back of your neck stand on end. The use of words such as vision, faith, and future helps to paint the dream of freedom, opportunity, and in some cases, healing old wounds. This is the language that will inspire your future community members, and you should endeavor to use it where appropriate. ([Location 4731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4731))
		- #Notes What kind of language should you use to motivate and inspire?
	- > The greatest inspirational writers are those who have been exposed to great inspirational writing. There have been many great orators throughout history: Winston Churchill and Martin Luther King, Jr. to name just two. Many websites have recordings and transcripts of their speeches. I highly recommend listening to or reading them and identifying the parts that you find most inspiring. Watch out for that tingly feeling up your spine. It is that feeling that we want to create. ([Location 4734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4734))
		- #Notes How can you learn inspirational writing from other writers?
	- > The most important tip to remember about inspirational messaging is that it must be genuine. Whatever path we follow to build our communities, our leaders must instill a sense of trust and representation. The enemy here is in appearing contrived and disingenuous. Our inspiration must be natural and genuine. If you are real, your community will see that. ([Location 4741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4741))
		- #Notes What do you need to keep in mind about authenticity when you want to motivate and inspire others?
	- > If your definition of community does not extend to the common expectation of volunteer environments, you will receive short shrift quickly. Readers seeking to build communities around commercial products should be particularly cognizant of this risk. Always remember that whatever their focus, communities are organic units of interest and collaboration. They live and breathe on an understanding that community efforts benefit the community as a whole. Anyone who tampers with that ethos will face problems. ([Location 4751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4751))
		- #Notes Why can't you force a community to form, especially not as a commercial company?
	- > I define advocacy as the putting forward of a positive message and investing one’s personal reputation in that message. Advocates recommend only products, technologies, and lifestyles that they personally subscribe to. Those people on street corners who want to talk your ear off about human rights are advocates. They may be annoying, but they genuinely live their message. For them it is not a job; it is a lifestyle. Sales are different. Some (not all) salespeople exemplify the philosophy of “I could sell ice to Eskimos.” In other words, they take pride in their ability to make the sale. The pride is in being convincing and charismatic. As such, salespeople are often able to detach themselves from the product they are selling. They can effectively work for any company that sells something. ([Location 4761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4761))
		- #Notes How are advocates and salespeople different?
	- > This makes life tough for an advocate. It means that in your heart of hearts, you can get out there and shout from the rooftops only about what you truly believe in. It also requires that implicit honesty in both directions: if your product sucks, you don’t cover it up but instead try to fix it. The upside is that when people know you are an advocate, and know this is how you tick, your opinion really counts to them. Advocacy requires trust: you are putting your belief behind your words. If people like you and trust you, they are likely to trust and like what you are advocating. ([Location 4775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4775))
		- #Notes What does authenticity require from an advocate, but what is the reward?
	- > we need to always ensure that our buzz is relevant. When we seek to excite and inspire people to join our community, we must target the right demographic. Our buzz always needs to be honest. We are all human, and we will all be tempted at some point to target those outside our demographic. Don’t. Sending unsolicited messages to people, no matter how you do it, will not only frustrate many people, but could harm your community. Who would want to join a community with a reputation for spamming? I certainly wouldn’t. ([Location 4791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4791))
		- #Notes Why should we avoid being spammers in promoting our community?
	- > Don’t be tempted into building a false prophecy: it never works. There is nothing wrong with getting excited and enthusiastic. Tell the world your community has grand ambitions, and inspire people to join. Just don’t sell your prospective contributors a story that doesn’t exist. Don’t tell them you have achieved things you haven’t. Don’t tell them you have more people involved than you do. Community is all about transparency and openness. In such a frank and unclouded environment, such exaggerations and fibs will be outed sooner than you think. When such nonsense is revealed, it causes a lack of faith in you and your community. Remember, trust is a non-negotiable requirement of community leaders. Don’t risk it. ([Location 4799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4799))
		- #Notes Why should you never lie about achievements as a community leader?
	- > Keep these aspects in mind when considering how to build your site: Great overview If I visit your website, I want to be able to get an overview of the community, its goals, and how to get involved, all within the space of a few minutes. This information should be up-front, easy to access, and easy to read, and should have a simple web address that you can point people to (e.g., www.myproject.com/overview). Great documentation Your website should provide documentation and guidance for all aspects of your community. This will always be an ongoing process, but you should consider which aspects of your community are most important and need to be documented. As an example, the process that new members follow to join your community should be a priority. Great communication You should ensure that it is really easy for people to get in touch with you with questions, suggestions, and feedback. I recommend that at a minimum you have an email address that is easy to access. This is a notable problem with many blogs. Many blogging tools (such as WordPress at the time of this writing) do not provide an easy-to-access contact link, and this can make it impossible to get in touch with the author of the blog. ([Location 4843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4843))
		- #Notes What are three key ingredients for community websites?
	- > There is also a new kind of website appearing called a planet. These websites take a number of syndication feeds about related subjects and show the posts in the correct order. This produces a rolling collection of interesting content: readers simply visit the planet and then read a large number of related websites that they were probably unaware of. A great example of this is Planet Ubuntu ([Location 4951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4951))
		- #Notes What is a planet website, and how can it give exposure to content creators in your community?
	- > Whenever you build buzz, you execute a set of procedures. When combined, this set of procedures ensures that you plan effectively, get as much anticipation for your announcement, and learn from the experience. These steps help frame the best practice involved in buzz making, and they will help you to better plan and structure how you get people excited about your community. The four stages are: Plan At this stage you sit down and build a recipe for what you want to achieve, how you can achieve it, and what is involved. Build up Instead of going straight to the main course, why not start with an appetizer? Build up some excitement and mystery before the main event kicks in. Announce The core of our buzz, this is where we kick it out there. Review This includes a postmortem of what we did, and an assessment of what worked, what didn’t, and how we can improve next time. ([Location 4973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4973))
		- #Notes What are the four stages of creating buzz?
	- > Many newcomers to the buzz-building business jump straight to the announcement, with a marginal level of planning. I strongly recommend against this. Buzz is an art form that can net incredible results for your community when executed correctly, but it can also cause lasting damage if you get it wrong. Planning and feedback will keep you with the former. ([Location 4982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4982))
		- #Notes Why should you take the time to plan generating buzz?
	- > The reason buzz requires planning is that, to excite people, you need to know your goals, what tools and resources you need, and how to roll out your plan. You want to squeeze as much juice out of your efforts as possible and get as much focus and attention on your community as possible. You want maximum return for your investment in time. ([Location 4993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4993))
		- #Notes Why do you need to plan generating buzz?
	- > Here are some questions you should have answers for: What outcome do you want to achieve? What medium(s) are you going to use to achieve it? What preparation work needs to occur before you can begin the buildup phase? What other people are involved in the buzz and what are their tasks? What is the timeline for the entire buzz cycle? The answers to these questions will give you a firm idea of your goals and how you can achieve them. For plans that involve only you, an awareness of the answers to these questions is enough. If you are going to be working with other people, however, you should document the answers. This will ensure that everyone is on the same page. ([Location 4997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=4997))
		- #Notes What should you document when planning to generate buzz?
	- > In this phase we want to tease people with a taste of what is to come. We want to pique their curiosity, tempt their senses, and get people chattering about what we are up to. When done right, this phase can deliver some riveting and memorable buzz, before you even announce what you are doing. ([Location 5017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=5017))
		- #Notes How can a sneak peek generate buzz?
	- > Buildup should only be used on genuinely interesting initiatives. Don’t bother using buildup on things that will fail to excite people. As an example, buildup would be great for a new project or initiative, but awful for a change in policy in how your community is governed. ([Location 5042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=5042))
		- #Notes Why isn't buildup to generate buzz not always a good technique?
	- > Postmortems are hugely valuable in any kind of work, and if you don’t perform them, you never learn how to improve. Whether you are evaluating how well you handled a discussion, cooked a meal, taught your kids how to play football, or built community buzz, a review can uncover great opportunities for improvement: Efficiency When you review your work, it gives you an opportunity to identify areas that are inefficient and redundant. You can use these as a basis for improvement. Feedback Gathering feedback from the people who consumed your buzz is a great way to see what they felt worked and what didn’t. This is a great opportunity to get feedback on your writing, structure, and the other concepts throughout this chapter. Ideas When any kind of postmortem of an approach occurs, it almost always generates new ideas. These will help future buzz cycles to be more effective. ([Location 5103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=5103))
		- #Notes Why should you do reviews after buzz-generating campaigns?
	- > In the review phase, revisit the questions you asked in the planning phase and compare the plan with what happened: Did you stick to your aim and communicate it well to others? Did you identify the right outcomes to achieve? Were your chosen mediums the most suitable? Did you prepare effectively? Did you communicate well to others involved in the buzz about what needed to be done? Was your timeline for the buzz cycle accurate? Did you hit your deadlines? ([Location 5111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=5111))
		- #Notes What questions should you ask when reviewing a buzz-generating campaign?
	- > You can see where your announcement spreads to and whether you were publicized in all the places you hoped. There’s also qualitative feedback: did comments and questions show that you described your project clearly? Did the types of people you want respond? ([Location 5151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=5151))
		- #Notes What insight can reviewing announcements give you?
	- > Although buzz campaigns can be started to attract contributors, this activity should be seen as an always-present and ongoing promotional effort. Your goal here is to constantly communicate the positive message of your community, its achievements, and how people can get involved. The greatest communicators of this message are your existing members: you want to turn their satisfaction into active promotion for your community. To achieve this, your members need to feel proud to be in your community. They should feel a drive and passion for your goals and objectives, and they should feel that they want to spread the word so that others can enjoy the community, too. A positive community will always generate a positive message and be a magnet for new contributors. The first step in achieving this is to build a sense of enjoyment, ease of contribution, and pride in your members. You build this by combining the elements discussed in this book: simple processes, effective governance, transparency, and so on. When you get these core attributes right, your members will thrive on the opportunities and direction your community offers them. You now need to encourage them to share their happiness and drive with others. ([Location 5157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=5157))
		- #Notes How can you cultivate a passion in community members so they promote the community?
	- > To encourage your members to share their joy of being a part of the community, the key is that the communication focuses on the personal story: you need to encourage your members to share what they specifically enjoy about the project. In doing this you resort to the essence of community that we discussed back at the beginning of the book: stories. Stories are a fantastic viral marketing asset. A great story is never told once; it is shared again and again. If your community members share great stories about their involvement in the community, the stories will travel far and wide and encourage new and unknown people to dip their feet into your waters. You should talk about the importance of sharing stories with your members. Help them to understand that on any given day they could talk to someone online, in a coffee shop, or on a train or plane and potentially inspire that person to join the community. This can provide your members with a powerful sense of opportunity for bringing people in and will get them involved. ([Location 5171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=5171))
		- #Notes Why should you encourage members to share their story of their experience with the community?
	- > As you grow your community, always be on the lookout for those who have a personality that is attuned to getting people excited about the community and the work it does. While you are taking on a responsibility to build buzz, if you can create a team of people who can also build buzz you will develop a much more scalable resource for building awareness and excitement about your community. People who can build buzz and excitement in a way that is natural and not obnoxious are few and far between, so keep your eyes open and your ear to the ground for these folks and grab ‘em when you can. ([Location 5209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=5209))
		- #Notes Why should you constantly be building your community's "buzz army"?
	- > community is very much a soft science. It is an art form that is improved and extended by sharing stories and experiences. It is these tales that extend our knowledge and offer us insight. The greatest gift you can offer to a community is the willingness to listen. When leaders listen, their community talks and everyone feels engaged. ([Location 5791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=5791))
		- #Notes Why should you always strive to show to your community that you're listening?
	- > Earlier in this book we constructed our strategic plan, which included a vocabulary identifying the key features of our strategy. Let’s have a quick recap: We first created a mission statement that outlined the broad aims of the community. Based on this statement we produced a set of high-level objectives. These are the major achievements that together form our mission statement. For each objective we have a set of goals. Each goal is a near-term outcome that we want to achieve. When we complete all the goals in an objective, we can consider the objective achieved. For each goal we have a set of actions. When we complete all of the actions in a goal, we can consider the goal achieved. As you can see, the different parts of the strategy are nested inside one another. They look something like this: Mission Statement Objective Goal Actions Actions Actions Goal Actions Actions Objective Goal Actions Actions ([Location 5808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=5808))
		- #Notes How do you write a strategic plan?
	- > The first step is to determine the purpose of the survey. What do you want to achieve with it? What do you need to know? Every survey needs to have a purpose, and it is this purpose that will help you craft a useful set of questions that should generate an even more useful set of data. ([Location 5941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=5941))
		- #Notes What is the first question you should always ask yourself before setting up a survey?
	- > your goals from your strategic plan are a key source of purpose for your surveys. As an example, if your goal is “increase the number of contributors in the community,” you should break down the workflow of how people join your community, and produce a set of questions that test each step in this workflow. You can use the feedback from the answers to gauge whether your workflow is effective and use the data as a basis for improvements. ([Location 5948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=5948))
		- #Notes How can you use surveys to support your strategic plan?
	- > I recommend that you structure your survey findings reports as follows: Present a broad conclusion, a paragraph that outlines the primary revelation that we can take away from the entire survey. For example, this could be “Developer growth is slower than expected and needs to improve.” It is this broad conclusion that will inspire people to read the survey. ... Document the primary findings as a series of bullet points. These findings don’t necessarily need to be the findings for each question, but instead the primary lessons to be learned from the entire survey. It is these findings that your community will take as the meat of the survey. They should be clear, accurate, and concise. Present a list of recommended actions that will improve on each finding. Each action should have a clear correlation with the findings that your survey presented. The reader should be able to clearly identify how an action will improve the current situation. One caveat, though: not all reports can present action items. Sometimes a factual finding does not automatically suggest an action item; it may take negotiation and discussion for leaders to figure out the right action. Finally, in the interest of completeness, present the entire set of data that you received in the survey. This is often useful as an addendum or appendix to the preceding information. This is a particularly useful place to present nonmultiple-choice answers (written responses). ([Location 5993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=5993))
		- #Notes How should you document/present the outcome of surveys?
	- > When you have completed your survey and documented these results, you should ensure that they are available to the rest of your community. Sharing these results with the community is (a) a valuable engagement in transparency, (b) a way to share the current status quo of the community with everyone, and (c) an opportunity to encourage others to fix the problems or seek the opportunities that the survey uncovers. To do this, you should put the report on your website. Ensure that you clearly note the date on which the results were taken. This will make it apparent to your readers that the results were a snapshot of that point in the history of your community. If you don’t provide a date, your community will assume the results are from today. When you put the results online, you should notify your community through whatever communication channels are in place, such as mailing lists, online chat channels, forums, websites, and more.

		- #Notes Why and how should you present survey findings with your community?
	- > When trying to measure the effectiveness of a process, an observational test can be one of the most valuable approaches. This is where you simply sit down and watch someone interact with something and take notes on what the person does. Often this can uncover nuances that can be improved or refined. ([Location 6021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=6021))
		- #Notes Why should you do observational tests for your community processes?
	- > Consider some of the following topics for these kinds of observational tests: Ask a member to find something on your website. Ask a prospective contributor to join the community and find the resources he needs. Ask a member to find a piece of information, such as a bug, a message on a mailing list, or another resource. Ask a member to escalate an issue to a governance council. ([Location 6080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=6080))

	- > “Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible.” — Frank Zappa ([Location 6284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=6284))
	- > Credibility is the respect you earn from different stakeholders, be they community members, management, founders, press, or others. Gaining credibility is critical if you want to be successful. Consequently, a lack of credibility can be rather damning. ... Credibility makes great things possible. Your community is inspired by you and seeks your leadership, your management entrusts some of the organization’s most delicate resources to you, and you are considered an invaluable resource to all stakeholders.

		- #Notes Why should you work to get credibility as a community leader?
	- > By structuring our work effectively and executing it in a predictable manner, we can better communicate outward the success of that work and the value it brings. Second, from a slightly more selfish perspective, all of this project management, tracking, and transparency is going to help us to develop the credibility we need to be successful. This is a no poseur zone, my friends. ([Location 6327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=6327))
	- > People can run on a platform of promises for only so long before faith erodes and cynicism and suspicion set in. This is precisely what we want to avoid. Whether you are running a community, a project, a department in your company, or anything else, you want to build a culture of delivery. The greatest contributors in any community or company start with a vision, break it down into pieces, and deliver the results. While many such contributors make great plans and even execute them well, too many people fail to track and articulate this progress to others; ... Successfully hot-rodding your work to track such progress and then clearly articulating your results will give you a reputation for bringing great value and will build your credibility. This work is important not only to build credibility, but also to reduce risk for your community and its ability to make decisions and deliver value.

	- > if you are not keeping score, and counting the right things, it doesn’t count. ([Location 6384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=6384))
	- > What’s important is that the act of keeping score allows you to do better work; it helps you to identify opportunities and improve problematic areas. My friend’s primary lesson was to avoid being lured down rabbit holes in which you track things that have no tangible benefits or outcomes. In other words, always ensure that you track your progress, but make sure the things you track will shed more light on areas in which you can drive improvements forward. We are not interested in just collecting numbers here; we are interested in collecting indicators of success and failure to help us map out the best possible path forward in our work. ([Location 6390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008224FMC&location=6390))
		- #Notes How can tracking your work improve what you focus on?
	- > In every community there are three broad areas in which you should have a solid workflow in place for tracking the work performed. They are: Projects A project is a unit of work that results in a particular outcome. Each project has a collection of steps that must be executed to achieve that outcome, and these steps are typically distributed across lots of different people, many of whom may be volunteers. Examples of projects include creating a website for a community team, building team reporting into your community, creating a new product feature, and forming a governance council. Growth and decline Communities are composed of many different moving parts. Examples include teams, processes for contributing work, governance boards, and more. For each moving part we want to track the growth and decline of content and people to ensure that they are working effectively. General health Outside of our projects and the mechanics of how our community operates, we also want to get a feel for the general health of the community, where we are seeing positive work, and where there are issues that need to be resolved.

		- #Notes What three areas of a community should you track?
	- > The trick in managing projects is to understand how different people are interested in different levels of visibility in your projects. When we can conceptualize these layers it helps us to better construct and manage our projects so that different people can see the projects with different lenses that expose different levels of detail. These three layers are: The Project level The Project level is the highest level of abstraction, where we just need to know whether the project is on track or not. The SUCCESS CRITERIA in our strategic plan help us to ask a definitive question about whether we succeeded in delivering the requirements of the project. For projects that are not yet complete, we also need to be able to take an acid test at any time to determine whether the project is generally on track. The Work Unit level In our strategic plan, the OBJECTIVE defines the high-level project and each GOAL specifies individual pieces of work that need to be completed to deliver the wider project goal. Each GOAL component may be owned and assigned to different people, and we need a means to identify whether work is succeeding at this slightly lower level. The Work Item level Each work unit is divided into a collection of work items that document individual tasks, each assigned to one person and taking no longer than half a day to complete. This is the highest level of detail required, and most people would only see this level of detail for projects they are actively involved in (and for which they have work items assigned to them). In a perfect world we would see all work items from all units and be able to see progress on each (we will talk about how to do this later in the chapter).
